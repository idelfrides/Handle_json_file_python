# Read json documents with python

### The Project
This is a project created to **read json files to mutables data structures** in Python 3. 
It is a solution to a challenge, the practical test for my admission in my last job as a **Back-end Developer.**

This project is about managing text file containing json document in python.
On it I build an app witch get content from a json file and put it into a mutable data structure chosen by user/you trough a menu of selection. 
The App use **OOP** and **Microserce Architecture** and organized like you can see on tab **<> Code** (in the top left menu).
- The folder **handle_json_files** is a python package witch contain modules(classes, python files). Each module keeps some methods, where each method is responsible to execute one task. The classes  has the same name with python file.
- The folder **files_dir** keeps the files created by user and can be deleted anytime he want. 
So,  That is a structure seted up to satisfy the  **Microserce Architecture** adopted .

The file **main.py** has one method, the main one, called - **main_test()** wich one controlls the app fully.

### Running App
To run this app you need to execute **main.py** file.


### The Challenge

The CHALLENGE consist in read a content from a json file('test.json' to our purpose) 
**without using the 'loads()' method from json package.** 
The CHALLENGE itself is only a reproduction of what the python function json.loads() does.


### The Solution
