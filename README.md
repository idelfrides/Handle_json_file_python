# Handle json documents with python

### The Project
This is a project created to **handle json files to mutables data structures** in Python 3.

This project is about managing text file containing json document in python.
On it I build an app witch get data in a json file and  put it into a mutable data structure shosen by user/you trough a menu of selection. 
The App use **OOP** and **Microserce Architecture** and organized  like you can see on aba    **<> Code** (in the top left menu).
- The folder **data_structures_lib** is a python package witch contain modules(classes, python files). Each module keeps several methods, where each method is responsible to execute one task. The classes  has the same name with python file.
- The folder **files_folder** keeps the files created by user and can be deleted anytime he want. 
So,  That is a structure seted up to satisfy the  **Microserce Architecture** adopted .

The file **run_app.py** has one method, the main one called - **main_app(n)** wich one controlls the app fully.

### Running App
To run this app you need to execute **run_app.py** file.
